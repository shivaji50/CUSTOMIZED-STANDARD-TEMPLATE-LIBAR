# CUSTOMIZED STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY
- This project is used to emulate almost all functionalities provided by STL in C++.

# Architectural requirement
- Intel 32 or 64 bit processor

# User Interface 
- Command User Interface

# Technology used 
- Programming using C++ 

# About Standard Template Library
- In this project we emulate almost all the data structures and its functionalty which are available in STL

- In this project we have created eight data structures as follows:

1 :Doubly Circular LinkList

2 :Doubly Linear LinkList

3 :Singly Circular LinkList

4 :Singly Linear LinkList

5 :Stack using LinkList

6 :Stack using Array

7 :Queue using LinkList

8 :Binary Search Tree

- I Have also implemented some new functionality which are not available in Original STL:

1 :First Occurance of element in the given list

2 :Last Occurance of element in the given list

3 :All Occurance of element in the given list

4 :Reverse the list
